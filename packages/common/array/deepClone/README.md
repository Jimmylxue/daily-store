# deepClone

How to realize deepClone? i think this question maybe often with you when you start coding!

I think i'm used to understand it all along, but actually, half an years i still can't complete understand. i am still has clearly remember: my colleague also is my leader, who tell me `[...array]` or `{...object}` at sometime could not realize deepClone, which is array or object child also is objet type, i just say "really ?" to express my surprise but i know agree it when hear she say.

But now, i though i was so silly, which is why i write it and implement `deepClone` function to record this!
